Existing products that can solve problems similar to the problems being solved here include search engines such as Google (https://www.google.com), Baidu (https://www.baidu.com), and Bing (https://www.bing.com). Compared with a more general population that these search engines are targeting, our product is designated for certain groups of users such as government, NGOs, academia, investors, startups, tech firms, and investment firms. Since each user requires login credentials, we can always generate the most relevant and detailed results for specific users. For example, we can provide resources for university professors who are interested in AI technology or graduate students that are planning on a startup company.

Though these search engines also include the users that we are targeting, they do not put as much emphasis on them as we do. They aim at providing resources of all kinds to attract users from different areas while our product will deeply concentrate on financial technology and immigration information within Canada. Therefore, our target users would have a better experience looking for the information that strictly concerns their demographic group.

Similar products such as Investopedia (https://www.investopedia.com), and YahooFinance (https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/) provide comprehensive Finance knowledge. Their resources are useful in general situations while our product can present more detailed information that is specifically Canada or Toronto-wide. Therefore, for both domestic and foreign companies that are looking for investment opportunities in Canada can easily find objective resources using our product.

There is also BMO chatbot (https://www.bmo.com/main/personal/chatbot/#how-do-i-access-skill), which is built for BMO customers looking for solutions to some frequently-asked questions. It is a one-to-one customer service. Users do not have to own an account under BMO to use the tool. Instead, they can use their facebook account to start the conversation with the chatbot. It is a convenient and useful tool for all BMO users, but it is lacking in some security. Our product actually allows users to either enter as a guest account or as a certified user with DFI.

There are other products that also provide support for startup companies in Canada, such as StartUpToronto (https://startupheretoronto.com), StartUpCanada (https://www.startupcan.ca), etc. These products offer startup opportunities in various industries. They provide a general picture of startup companies' environment and futures. However, for those who have determined to get involved in financial innovation, our product would be a better choice as it provides more detailed and professional resources regarding this area.

All the products listed above either have same target users or share similar resources, but their performance is different from one to another. Our product has a simple and clear focus: Users who are interested in financial services looking for resources and solutions can get the best experience here.
