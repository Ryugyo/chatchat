The objective of our group project is to create a Chatbot for FinTech ecosystem in Canada. This web-based Chatbot is able to return the most appropriate answer for user's input question, and all results are extract from the corpus database created by DFI. Currently there exist many chatbot applications in different fields such as help centre of e-commerce company, in addition most of search engines are able to recognize user's given question and searching up for a relevant answer efficiently. Our goal is to make a Chatbot application which not only serves in one specific field but also satisfy requirements of users from different areas, backgrounds, and skill sets, while making sure it is extremely easy to use.

The key users are from: government, startups, academia, new immigrant, tech firms.
The following personas are create one for each category (Academia, New Immigrant, Government):

* Academia: Donna Valens is a Management Student in University of Toronto, she is 22 years old. She is experienced in using Excel and Word for her school works and collects what she need through internet.

* Tech Firms: Raja Syed, a 35 years old manager of DFI. He graduated from software engineering and is proficient in computer science field. Currently he is working for DFI and he wants to know his customersâ€™ behaviour from multiple perspectives.

* Government: Jeff Donnie is a 43 years old civil service employee. He has knowledge of the current state of affairs in the government. He wants to learn more in FinTech and AI so that he knows where the country could go in the world of finance.

The principle of this project is to insure the user experience as simplicity as possible. We will provide users with an easy to read interface and make sure every user is able to get started quickly at first time. Meanwhile the relevancy of search results is also a emphasis for our team, we shall guarantee the return result will always certainly solve user's question.
